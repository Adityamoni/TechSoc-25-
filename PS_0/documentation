Addressing limitatons and precison of the machine 
 This system uses algorithms combined with McLauren series to compute the request attested by the user. 
 DMAS and power(indices) and square-roots(second radical) in standard calculator is accurate as it includes the direct firmware.
 Natural, common logaritm and exponent are algorithmized to provide accurate answers till second decimal places. 
 Sines, Cosines and Tangents are made directly from mclauren series in which sines and cosines are accurate to two decimals while tangents are less. 
 Arcs of sines cosines and tangents are least accurate from mclauren, as the series converges slowly near (for eg arcsine) 1 
 Lastly the decimal index is also accurate to two decimal places and uses logarithm and exponent algorithms and at times could give varying answers.

 ---INSTRUCTIONS--- 
 For the usage of standard Calc functions please use the syntax <num1> <operator> <num2> 
 Using Scientific functions, please enter the operation FIRST followed by the numerica.
 We appreciate your patience. Fly safe!
Please chose the mode of Calculation; enter 'std' for standard or 'scf' for scientific.
std
Please enter in the proper syntax 
 The operators supported are: 
 + for addition 
 - for substraction 
 * for multipication 
 / for division 
 ^ for index/raise power(including decimal) 
 s for second-radical or square-root.  Information: square root is denoted by 's', and enter the same number both sides
